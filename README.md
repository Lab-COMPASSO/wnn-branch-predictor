# Conditional Branch Predictor Based on Weightless Neural Networks

Code and algorithms used in my Master's Thesis.

## Datasets:

  - The "Dataset_pc_decimal" folder provides the 6 datasets used in this work. 
  - In each file, the first column represents the PC in decimal and the second column represents the real outcome of the actual branch
